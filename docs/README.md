# naylang
An interpreter and debugger for the Grace programming language

## Compilation instructions
`naylang` uses standard out-of-source compilation with CMake. It requires at least version 3 of CMake and a compiler that supports C++14 (for example, GCC6.x).
When all the dependencies are installed, a simple sequence of commands should suffice to run the tests:

Alternatively, there is a compilation/launch script in the `dists/` folder, for GCC users:
